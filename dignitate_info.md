# Dignitate Information Summary

## Our Story
Founded by Malcolm Gill after 11 years caring for his mother with vascular dementia. The charity was born from the realization that while challenges exist, support and community make the journey manageable. It aims to provide a platform for caregivers to share experiences, connect, and learn.

## Mission
Dignitate advances cultural equity in caregiving through global advocacy, digital innovation, and culturally competent training. We empower carers and influence systems by combining lived experience, community insight, and strategic partnerships — driving policy change, shifting narratives, and building an international Cultural Carers movement.

## Vision
A world where cultural carers are recognised as key partners in health systems, and where culturally competent care is embedded globally — influencing policy, shaping practice, and transforming the dementia journey for families everywhere.
